    steps:
    # 1. Check out the code
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # 2. Set up Python (Matches your local environment)
    # We use 3.10 or 3.11 stable (avoiding the rc1 issue you had locally)
    - name: Set up Python 3.11
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: "3.11"
        cache: 'pip' # Caches your dependencies to make future runs faster

    # 3. Install Dependencies
    # This mirrors your "pip install ..." step
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        if [ -f requirements-dev.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements-dev.txt; fi
        # Explicitly install the package in editable mode if your tests rely on it
        pip install -e .

    # 4. Verify Docker Compose is available (Optional sanity check)
    - name: Check Docker Version
      run: |
        docker compose version

    # 5. Run your Make target
    # This will execute 'docker-compose up', run tests, and 'down' 
    # (assuming that is what your Makefile does)
    - name: Run Container Tests
      run: make container-test
